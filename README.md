# bankist_v1
# Description
- This is a bank application I developed in JavaScript while taking the course: "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!"
- In development, I built out the functionality of various features as I learned more about Arrays, Numbers, Dates, Intl and Timers in the Javascript environment
- This project demonstrates my newfound understanding of these JavaScript features and my ability to apply them to future projects
