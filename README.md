# bankist_v1
# Description
- This is a bank application I developed in JavaScript while taking the course: "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!"
- In development, the functionality of various features were built out as I learned more about Arrays, Numbers, Dates, Intl and Timers in the Javascript environment
- Demonstrated on this project is my newfound understanding of the uses of these JavaScript features to further my abilities for future projects
